## 1. Mark Sprinkler Heads and Underground Utilities
Before aeration, it's important to mark the locations of any sprinkler heads, invisible dog fences, or other underground utilities. This helps us avoid damaging these systems during the process. You can use flags or markers to clearly identify these areas.

## 2. Mow Your Lawn
For best results, mow your lawn to a shorter height (about 1.5-2 inches) before we arrive. This makes it easier for our equipment to access the soil and ensures better coverage. If your lawn is too long, the aerator may have difficulty penetrating the surface effectively.

## 3. Water the Lawn
Moist soil is ideal for aeration. Water your lawn thoroughly the day before our scheduled visit. This softens the soil, allowing the aerator to remove deeper plugs. However, avoid over-watering, as muddy conditions can make aeration more difficult.

## 4. Clear Debris
Please remove any large debris from your lawn, such as branches, toys, or lawn furniture. This ensures the aeration process can proceed smoothly and safely.

## 5. Plan for Lawn Traffic
After aeration, your lawn will have small plugs of soil on the surface. It's best to limit foot traffic and avoid mowing for a few days to allow the plugs to break down and for the soil to settle back into place.

## 6. Watering New Seed
If you're overseeding after aeration, consistent watering is key to helping the new grass grow. Water lightly 2/3 times every day for the first two weeks to keep the soil moist. The soil should never be dry for the first 2 weeks. Once the seeds begin to sprout, gradually increase watering durations and decrease the frequency to once or twice per day. This will support deeper root development.


## 7. Relax and Enjoy the Results
Once you've completed these simple steps, you're all set! We'll take care of the rest and leave your lawn in great shape for healthier growth.

If you have any questions or concerns before aeration day, please don't hesitate to reach out. We look forward to helping you achieve a healthier, greener lawn!
