# What is Core Aeration?

Core aeration is a lawn care process that involves removing small plugs of soil from the ground, creating small holes in the turf. This reduces soil compaction, allowing water, air, and nutrients to penetrate deep into the root zone. The plugs that are removed are left on the surface to decompose, providing natural nutrients back into the soil.

## Benefits of Core Aeration:

**Relieves Soil Compaction:** Compacted soil restricts the flow of air, water, and nutrients, making it difficult for grass roots to grow. Aeration breaks up the compaction, creating space for roots to expand.

**Improves Water and Nutrient Uptake:** By creating channels for water and nutrients to reach the root zone, aeration promotes healthier, deeper root systems.

**Reduces Thatch Build-Up:** Thatch is a layer of dead grass and roots that can build up over time. Aeration helps break down thatch, allowing for better air circulation and preventing potential problems like lawn diseases.

**Encourages Thicker Turf Growth:** With better root development, your grass will grow thicker, making your lawn more resilient and visually appealing.

## What is Overseeding?

Overseeding is the practice of spreading new grass seed over an existing lawn to fill in bare spots and improve the density of the turf. It’s often done in conjunction with aeration to maximize the chances of seed germination by taking advantage of the open soil created by the aeration process.

## Benefits of Overseeding:

**Fills in Thin Areas:** If your lawn has bare spots or areas with thin grass, overseeding can help thicken these areas and create a more uniform look.

**Improves Lawn Resilience:** Overseeding introduces new, healthy grass varieties that are more resistant to diseases, pests, and drought conditions.

**Enhances Overall Lawn Appearance:** A thicker lawn not only looks better but also crowds out weeds, reducing the need for chemical weed control.

**Strengthens Grass During Cooler Seasons:** Overseeding in the fall helps prepare your lawn for cooler months, ensuring it grows back stronger and more vibrant in the spring.

## Best Practices for Aeration and Overseeding

**Aerate Annually:** For most lawns, annual core aeration is recommended, typically in the fall or spring when grass is actively growing.

**Combine Aeration with Overseeding:** Overseeding right after aeration gives grass seed the best chance to take root, as the open holes in the soil make it easier for seeds to settle in and grow.

**Water Consistently:** After overseeding, consistent watering is essential for seed germination. Make sure to keep the soil moist until the new grass is established.
