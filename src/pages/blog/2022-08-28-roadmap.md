The following are some potential features that are being considered as enhancements to this starter. Please consider [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/hellotham) us if these features are important to you and you would like them to be implemented sooner. Alternately, if you want to implement any of these features, please let us know and we will be happy to support you!

- Automatic optimization of images in Markdown/MDX posts

Current issues:

- MDX content currently not included in search as it does not support rawContent property.
- Better support for Mermaid (awaiting possible official integration by Astro)
- Should really use load Mermaid and Markmap scripts from packages rather than external CDN.
