# Sommer Lawn
Website for https://sommerlawn.com
This is an [Astro](https://astro.build) website based on the [Hello Astro](https://github.com/hellotham/hello-astro) starter theme which uses Typescript, TailwindCSS, Markdown and MDX. It follows the [JAMstack architecture](https://jamstack.org) by automatically building a static version from the Git repository and deploying to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com).

## Development
### Get Started
- `git clone` this repo and cd to the repo directory
- `npm install -g pnpm` Install performant NPM which is required for builds and deployment
- `pnpm install` Install dependencies
- `pnpm dev` Run local server for local development

### Adding New Features
- When adding new features, create a feature branch. E.g: `git checkout -B new-contact-page` and develop from that branch.
- When local development works, deploy those updates by pushing to the remote feature branch which will build a Netlify Deploy Preview. E.g, with the feature branch checked out: `git push` and then you can check how the Deploy Preview looks.
- If the Deploy Preview looks good, then you can open a PR and merge to the `main` git branch, which will then automatically deploy to production and make your new changes live on https://sommerlawn.com.

### Notes on Deploying to the Netlify Environment
- All commits to the main branch are automatically deployed to production on Netlify at https://sommerlawn.com.
- Builds for deployments to Netlify should be handled in `netlify.toml` and `package.json`, not in the Netlify GUI.
- Don't upgrade packages unless required.
- Packages should be handled via `pnpm-lock.yaml` and commited since that is what the production build will use via the `pnpm i --frozen-lockfile && pnpm build` command.
- Develop with the same version of Node that Netlify will use and specify that in `package.json`.

## 🧞 Commands
All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

Astro looks for `.astro`, `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

`src/components/` is where we put any Astro components and similarly `src/layouts/` for layouts.

Images can be placed in `src/assets/`.

Blog and documentation content are created as collections of Markdown or MDX files in `src/content`.

Any static assets, eg. images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
