Astro looks for `.astro`, `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

`src/components/` is where we put any Astro components and similarly `src/layouts/` for layouts.

Images can be placed in `src/assets/`.

Blog and documentation content are created as collections of Markdown or MDX files in `src/content`.

Any static assets, eg. images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
