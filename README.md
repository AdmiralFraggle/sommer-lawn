## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside this starter, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.ico
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ header.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ image.png
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ base.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ blog/
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ 2022-08-01-post.md

â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ image.svg
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config.ts
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro`, `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

`src/components/` is where we put any Astro components and similarly `src/layouts/` for layouts.

Images can be placed in `src/images/` or `src/svg/` depending on type.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands
